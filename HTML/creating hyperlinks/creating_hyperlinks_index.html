    <div>    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a 
      distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris 
      when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a 
      domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is 
      part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely
       abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The 
       dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern</p><p></p>
        wolves are not closely related to the wolves that 
        were first domesticated,[12][13][14] which implies
         that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15]
          The dog was the first species to be domesticated,
          [14][16] and has been selectively bred over 
          millennia for various behaviors, sensory
           capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>
